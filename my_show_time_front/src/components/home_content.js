                         Machine Learning is the field of study
                         that gives computers the capability to
                         learn without being explicitly
                         programmed. ML is one of the most exciting
                         technologies that one would have ever
                         come across. As it is evident from the
                         name, it gives the computer that makes
                         it more similar to humans: The ability
                         to learn. Machine learning is actively
                         being used today, perhaps in many more
                         places than one would expect.
