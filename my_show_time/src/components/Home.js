          Hunting down a relevant job requires
          proper techniques for showcasing your
          potential to the employer. But with
          the advent of COVID-19, it has become
          a bit challenging and competitive to
          reach out for your dream job. Many
          individuals have lost their jobs
          during these times, and on the other
          hand, freshers are facing difficulties
          while applying for a new job. But
          there is no need for panic, you can
          change your ways and streamline things
          in a way that you get a proper result.
